# Storm Engine
Storm Engine is a work-in-progress game engine written in C++17.
At its current stage, it cannot run a functional game.
Practically all of the major features of a game engine are missing.

## TODO
- [ ] **Complete the Entity-Component-System model**. We currently only have entities and components. Sort of.
- [ ] **Switch to CMake/Premake**. Just using Visual Studio is an horrible idea for cross-platform applications.
- [ ] **Add Linux Support**. Linux is a major platform for gaming, too.
- [ ] **Add MacOS Support**. Despite not being used for gaming often, it is a major PC platform.
- [ ] **Add GCC Support**. Some support has been established but it is incomplete.
- [ ] **Add a proper Sandbox**. The current Test project is basically a joke.
- [ ] **Levels**. We need maps, to some extent. For that we need a format, too.
- [ ] **Engine Loop**.
- [ ] **Abstract Input System**.
- [ ] **Abstract Graphics System**.
- [ ] **Abstract Networking**.
- [ ] **Multi-Platform Entry Points**.

## FAQ
**Q:** What's even the point of this?  
**A:** Educational project, really. Learning how to make a Game Engine will give you insight into a lot of things.

**Q:** Should I use this for my game project?  
**A:** Absolutely not. This is hardly a finished product. In fact, it's hardly a functional product.

**Q:** Can I help?  
**A:** Yes! Feel free to submit Pull Requests or Issues at any time.

**Q:** Why C++?  
**A:** There are alternatives (i.e. Rust), but C++ has been regarded as the industry standard for game development for many years.

**Q:** The setup of the project is weird.  
**A:** Feel free to suggest changes to the layout, too!
